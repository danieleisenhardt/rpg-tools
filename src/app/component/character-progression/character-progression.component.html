        <h2>Gradual learn-by-doing</h2>
        <p>
            A popular system in many computer RPGs. Each skill has it's own experience points.
            Every time a character uses a skill points are awarded for that skill.
            A skill level is a function of the number of experience points gained in that skill,
            by taking the square root of total experience for example:
        </p>
        <code>skill level = sqrt(experience / 100) </code>
        <p>
            There are several disadvantages to this system, which make it unsuitable for the type
            of game I'm trying to make:
        </p>
        <ul class="align-left">
            <li>There is no distinct moment of 'leveling up' where a character's abilities increase noticeably.</li>
            <li>Characters can become great at everything. Since games generally do not have the constraints of real life.</li>
            <li>Players tend to build jack-of-all-trades characters. As there is no in-game disadvantage to it.</li>
            <li>
                It can easily make the game feel grindy, unrewarding and generally not enjoyable to anyone trying to play optimally.
                While more casual players would be considerably weaker.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Five points per level</h2>
        <p>This system simply awards the player 5 points to increase their character's attributes with every time they level up.</p>
        <p>
            The problem I have with this system is that a fighter could easily put all of their points into strength;
            a ranger could do the same with dexterity.
            Even worse, this may very well be the optimal thing to do.
